Upload-tweet
============

This repository provides a sample program to upload tweets using the python-twitter library (https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/). It reads tweets from a file, so you can upload as many tweets as you want in a quick session.

You can visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps to create a new app and then authorize using you own twitter account.
